Finally I decided moving forward to Jekyll. At the moment with the basic configuration it seems pretty simple.

I am not interested in design for now. So I will not make template design changes.

I am also writing this post using Atom text editor.

As Jekyll no uses database and due to cache system implemented by GitHub it is fast as hell.

By now I get these advantages:

- free hosting at GitHub
- speed
- do not have to worry about security updates
